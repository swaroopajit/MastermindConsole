# Mastermind
This is a part of the Odin Project's curriculum. 
The game is played entirely in the console.

The game visuals are heavily inspired by [Rachel Moser](https://github.com/rlmoser99)'s version of the same thing.

You can play the game by clicking [here!](https://replit.com/@SwaroopAjit/Mastermind?v=1) (Click on 'not run yet' to start the game.)
